# highlight-chars.el

I have no connection with this package. Please see [the entry on
EmacsWiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowWhiteSpace#HighlightChars)
for more details about it.

I'm simply holding a copy here because Melpa no longer serves packages that
are served from EmacsWiki, hc.el doesn't seem to have been ported to a more
trusted host, and so seems to have been removed. Because of this I'm keeping
my own mirror of it around and serving it to myself via
[delpa](https://blog.davep.org/delpa/).
